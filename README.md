#SKYRIMRP
SkyrimRP is a role play text game based on the popular video game named Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The goal of this text game is to create a mini playable version of an Alternate Universe of the original franchise. The user will get a chance to decide which of the three popular factions in the game he wants to belong and make choices that will determine if he lives or dies.

Right now the only storyline that its idea is completely written is the Thieves Guild.
